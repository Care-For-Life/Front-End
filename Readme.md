## Care For Life

#### Minimal Viable Product (MVP)

1. Caching results offline and be able to send them to the database at another point in time when connected to Internet.
2. Display survey questions in React Native App

The current data collection system we have in place is outdated and difficult to access.

#### Stretch Goals 
1. Translating between Portuguese and English may be potential issue.
2. Creating a clear way to display the data once it has been uploaded

#### Proposal
- What problem does your app solve?
  * The process for collecting and storing our data is too cumbersome, data is hand written, then scanned and then manually entered taking hours of time. The database is 15 years old and is difficult to access and use.

- Be as specific as possible; how does your app solve the problem?
  * Eliminate paper and pen system that the company has been using for 15 years with local storage caching on tablets.
  * Save field workers' time having to manually upload the data to the US.
  * Deal with concerns about another natural disaster wiping out their records.

#### Features
- What features are required for your minimum viable product?


- What features may you wish to put in a future release?


#### What do the top 3 similar apps do for their users?
1. Main competitors


#### UX Design
- What design system will you use?
  * Figma Tool to build out wire frames for design and user flow, color pallete etc.
  
###### What is the URL to your wireframes?
 - Figma Wireframe: 

  * Tool to pick with : TBD
  * Color palette choice: TBD
  * Type system: TBD
  * Tool to reference: TBD
  * Typography choice: TBD
  * Icon system: TBD

#### What will your user flow be?
* 

#### Frameworks and Libraries
- What 3rd party frameworks/libraries are you considering using?



#### Target Audience

- Who is your target audience? Be specific.


- What feedback have you gotten from potential users?


- Have you validated the problem and your solution with your target audience? How?


#### Research
_Research thoroughly before writing a single line of code. Solidify the features of your app conceptually before implementation. Spend the weekend researching so you can hit the ground running on Monday._

**Research material:**

#### Prototype Key Features
This is the “bread and butter” of the app, this is what makes your app yours. Calculate how long it takes to implement these features and triple the time estimated. That way you’ll have plenty of time to finish. It is preferred to drop features and spend more time working on your MVP features if needed.
